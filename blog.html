                                The read-only sessionStorage property accesses a session Storage object for the current
                                origin. sessionStorage is similar to localStorage; the difference is that while data in
                                localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session
                                ends.

                                        Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page
                                        session gets created and assigned to that particular tab. That page session is
                                        valid only for that particular tab.

                                        A page session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open, and survives
                                        over page reloads and restores.

                                        Opening a page in a new tab or window creates a new session with the value of
                                        the top-level browsing context, which differs from how session cookies work.

                                <strong>Event Loop:</strong> The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's
                                asynchronous
                                programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a
                                few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.

                                Easy Definition :
                                The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the
                                Callback Queue or Message Queue.

                                If the Call Stack is empty, it will take the first event from the
                                Callback queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.

                                Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
                                Each event is just a function callback.

                                Easiest explanation :
                                When any Asynchronous event occur such as setTimeOut or promises...
                                Then these task takes some time to complete I/O if they have any.
                                If they completed their I/O or don't have any, then they simply put into
                                message queue or callback queue. Then event loop will firstly execute the
                                call stack tasks and then look for callback or message queue and then execute it

                                JavaScript provides some primitive as well as non-primitive data types. For example
                                “null”, “boolean”, “undefined”, etc. belong to the primitive data type while “arrays”,
                                and “objects” are non-primitive or complex data types. In JavaScript, any variable that
                                is not assigned with any value has a default value of “undefined”. <br><br>

                                What is undefined in JavaScript?
                                The undefined type belongs to the primitive data types that can have only one value i.e.
                                undefined. A variable that is declared/created but not assigned with a value anywhere in
                                the program has a default value of “undefined”.

                                Here is the basic syntax for the JavaScript undefined type:
                                <br>
                                1.<br>

                                How to use undefined in JavaScript?
                                Let’s consider some use cases of JavaScript undefined type:
                                <br>
                                Example1: variable declared but not defined
                                In this example, we will check the type of a variable that is declared but not defined
                                anywhere in the program:
                                <br><br>
                                In this example:

                                We declared/created a variable “x” and didn’t assign it a value.
                                Next, we utilized the “typeof” operator to find the type of “x”.
                                Consequently, we get the below-given result:

                                The typeof operator returned undefined which verified that an unassigned variable has a
                                default value of “undefined”.
                                <br><br>
                                Example2: type of an empty string
                                Let’s consider we have an empty string as shown in the below snippet:

                                1.<br>
                                var x = "";
                                The task is to check the type and value of an empty string:
                                <br>
                                var x = "";
                                console.log(x);
                                console.log(typeof(x));
                                The above snippet utilized the console.log() method:
                                <br><br>

                                To print the value of x.
                                To print the data type of x.
                                As a result, we get the below-given output:
                                <br><br>
                                The output verified that an empty string and an undefined variable are two different
                                things. The undefined variable has a data type “undefined” while an empty string has a
                                data type “string”.
                                <br><br>
                                Example3: check if a variable is defined or not
                                In this example program, we will check whether a specific variable is defined or not. If
                                the program does not define the variable, display the message “variable not defined!”.
                                Else show the message “variable defined”:
                                <br><br>
                                var x;
                                if (typeof x === "undefined") {
                                message = "variable not defined!";
                                console.log(message);
                                } else {
                                message = "variable defined!";
                                console.log(message);
                                }<br><br>
                                The above code served the below given functionalities:
                                <br><br>
                                Declared a variable “x”.
                                Next, compared the value of “x” with the “undefined” type.
                                Printed “variable not defined” if the program does not define the variable.
                                Else displayed the message “variable defined”:
                                <br><br>
                                This is how the undefined type works in JavaScript.
                                <br>
                                Conclusion
                                In JavaScript, the undefined is a primitive type and has only one value “undefined”. A
                                variable that is declared/created but not assigned with a value anywhere in the program
                                has a default value of “undefined”.
